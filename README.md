# Thread-Safe Malloc Implementation

- Intro:  
  This project implements two memory allocation functions from the C standard library: `malloc` and `free`  
  - `malloc()`: takes in a size (number of bytes) for a memory allocation, locates an address in the programâ€™s data region where there is enough space to fit the specified number of bytes, and returns this address for use by the calling program.  
  - `free()`: takes an address (that was returned by a previous malloc operation) and marks that data region as available again for use.

- Features:    
  1. No-Lock Synchronization for multithreading:  
    By using Local Thread Storage (LTS), each thread is given a local storage for storing their pointer to the free list's head. In doing so, each thread will have its own free list of blocks while sharing the non-free blocks with all other threads, hence no race condition could be possibly raised between any two threads.  
  2. Auto-merging of newly freed region with any currently free adjacent regions:   
    The bookkeeping data structure would not contain multiple adjacent free regions, as this would lead to poor region selection during malloc.
