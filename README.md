# Thread-Safe Malloc Implementation

- Intro:  
  This project implements two memory allocation functions from the C standard library: `malloc` and `free`  
  - `malloc()`: takes in a size (number of bytes) for a memory allocation, locates an address in the programâ€™s data region where there is enough space to fit the specified number of bytes, and returns this address for use by the calling program.  
  - `free()`: takes an address (that was returned by a previous malloc operation) and marks that data region as available again for use.
